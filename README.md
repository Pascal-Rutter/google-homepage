Beginning:
Right now I'm planning on rebuilding a Website 
(i guess the front page of google)

End:
I have created and styled the 3 main elements of the Google front page.
Including a NavigationBar approach for the top element, a form for the
searchfield and a footer for the well footer.
I have learned to use the basics of the grid model.
And I am still considering to reorganize the code by excluding the CSS Style
into an extern file.
